# BidSphere – Online Auction System

BidSphere is a full-stack, real-time online auction platform designed to handle high-concurrency bidding, automated bidding logic, admin-controlled auction verification, and secure online payments. The system clearly separates user and admin responsibilities to maintain fairness, transparency, and platform integrity.

---

## System Overview

BidSphere operates on a controlled auction lifecycle where:
- Users create and participate in auctions.
- Admin verifies auctions, payments, and platform compliance.
- All bidding is real-time, validated, and concurrency-safe.
- Payments and commissions are handled securely.

---

## User Dashboard Flow

### 1. Registration & Authentication
- User registers using email.
- OTP is sent for email verification.
- Account activates only after OTP verification.
- User logs in and gains access to dashboard.

---

### 2. Auction Discovery
From the dashboard, the user can:
- Browse auctions by category:
  - Upcoming
  - Live
  - Ended
  - Cancelled
- Search auctions by keyword.
- Sort and filter auctions by price, time, and category.

---

### 3. Auction Creation (Seller Flow)
User can create an auction by providing:
- Product images
- Item condition (new, used, etc.)
- Starting price
- Minimum bidding amount
- Minimum bid increment
- Reserved price
- Buy It Now price (optional)
- Registration start & end time
- Bidding start & end time

Status:  
Auction remains inactive until admin approval.

---

### 4. Auction Participation (Buyer Flow)
- User registers for an auction by paying a token fee.
- Only registered users can place bids.
- Buy It Now option is available only before auction registration starts.

---

### 5. Bidding
#### Manual Bidding
- Bid must be at least:



#### Auto-Bidding
- User sets a maximum bid limit.
- System automatically places bids based on minimum increment.
- Auto-bid stops if another bidder exceeds the max limit.
- User receives an email notification if outbid.

---

### 6. Auction Extension
- If a bid is placed within the last 2 minutes:
- Auction extends by 10 minutes.
- Prevents unfair last-second bidding.

---

### 7. Auction Completion & Payment
- Highest bidder wins when auction ends.
- Winner receives email notification.
- Razorpay UPI payment link generated (valid for 5 hours).

If winner pays:
- Admin verifies payment.
- Commission deducted.
- Auction closed.

If winner fails to pay:
- Next highest bidder is notified.
- Admin approval required to proceed.

## Admin Dashboard Flow

---

## Revenue Model

Admin earns through:

---

## Real-Time & Concurrency Design

- Socket.IO handles live bid updates.

---
